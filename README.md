# TAVRFSIAnalysis
This repository contains geometry and mesh files that has been derived/reconstructed from patient-specific CT data used in our evaluation study. 
These are geometry files that contains no specific patient information. Geometry files can be opened using any CAD/Meshing sofware and mesh files are stored in tecplot format. The STL software could be imported into any meshing software for meshing followed by fluid-structure interaction (FSI) computation (with boundary conditions as explained in the methodolgy section) using any inhouse/commercial CFD software with FSI capability.
